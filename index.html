        <p>We are open to feedback to how roles and responsibilities should be setup. Particularly when it comes to this particular role.

Initially we'd like for the program manager to work closely with the <a href="https://www.sesameworkshop.org/ target="_blank"> Sesame Workshop</a> (The team behind Sesame Street). As well the team at, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/ target="_blank">Khan Academy.</a> To see how we could help these two organizations continue to scale their operations globally. </p>

In addition to this, each time someone who does not have security clearance tries to access the data, that some flag goes off and an appropriate team is notified. Your secondary task is to ensure that the data is accessible, in order for the system to actually function. You are someone who is at the forefront of what is going on in the blockchain+AI space.</p>

<h2> For Future partners (employees) at Awake</h2>
We offer:
<ul>
  <li>A collaborative, open, inclusive work environment. Where ideas > heirarchy</li>
  <li>Base salary</li>
  <li>Shares in the organization are going to be allocated based on a) A vesting schedule and b) The human population will actually determine what the individual contributor's share should be. This is something that we are currently evaluating. As well, this is something that we are going to build on top of a public/private blockchain. Effectively speaking, the organization and the original founding team is not going to have total control over how the shares are allocated.</li>
  <li>Benefits. Including but not limited to: Health insurance, basic dental related service (for now), mental health, vision care (eyeglasses and eye exams for now), sick days (physiological, psychological, emotional well-being). <b>Note:</b> Everything is super basic right now. As we do not have sales and we have not raised any money. </li>
  <li>Schedule: Monday to Thursday.</li>
  <li>Open to suggestions. What else should be added to this list?</li>
</ul>
